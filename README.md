#### ⚡ SpoilSaver: An app that works as your seamless kitchen assisant ⚡
**The Problem** - Americans waste an average of $1600/yr on food. 
That's equivalent to 1 year of gas or ~$30 per grocery trip thrown in the trash. 
Once thrown away, food is transported to a landfill where it goes to sit, decompose, and contribute to the warming of our planet.  With the effects of global warming continually becoming apparent, food prices rising and the money we earn getting stretched thinner each year, the need for a solution that would support the lack of management when it comes to our kitchen is clear. 

**Our Solution** - My team and I are working to create an app to help users keep track of the food they have while saving money and reducing food waste. It leverages ML and AI to provide users with a simple interface that takes 3-clicks to add food to your virtual kitchen assistant. Capable of notifying users before food expires, providing recipes using what they have in their kitchen, and connecting users to food donation centers nearby; our goal is to deliver **SpoilSaver** - your seamless kitchen assistant.
